#Problem 1
Programmed in Java, an algorithm that takes two
strings and returns true if they are anagrams of
each other, false otherwise. Algorithm runs in
**O( max(a, b) )** time.

#Problem 2
Programmed in Java, an algorithm that takes an
array of ascendingly-positive integers and a value,
searches the array for that value; returns the
value if found and -1 otherwise. Algorithm runs in
**O( log n )** time.
